# CAF-climate-risk-footprint

CAF - West of England - 174

The R project for creating a climate risk footprint for 6 community groups in the west of England. This project draws on different climate risk assessmets and attempts to create a simple assessment for the relevant community groups based on a) their vulnerability b) their susceptibility to climate change (in particular flooding and overheating) and c) their ability to adapt to climate change.
